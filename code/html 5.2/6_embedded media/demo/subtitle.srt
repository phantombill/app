00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,159
(Title: Saebit Day Plans,
Bazaar, New Light Prince)

2
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:13,838
Okay, guys. At the count of three,

3
00:00:13,878 --> 00:00:15,969
you're going to choose someone, okay?

4
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:26,759
One, two,

5
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:29,398
three.

6
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:42,599
What are you doing, Shin-Woo?
Do you want to be the prince?

7
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,919
Yes!

8
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,319
Then, with a unanimous vote,

9
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:00,158
the participant for the New Light
Prince Contest this year will be...

10
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,398
Woo Tae-Gyeong!
Give him a round of applause.

11
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,919
Congratulations, Tae-Gyeong.

12
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,478
No way.

13
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:18,119
(Saebit Boy High School Meeting)

14
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,238
You guys planned it...

15
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:23,199
while I was in the bathroom, right?

16
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,158
You agreed to choose me, right?

17
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,559
What are you talking about?
What do you take us for?

18
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:31,878
When you were in the bathroom,
we didn't do anything.

19
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,679
We just sat here.

20
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,919
Right, Shin-Woo?

21
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:44,438
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,199
I knew it.

23
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,639
We need good teamwork to pull off a con.

24
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,238
Why are your ears so red?

25
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,119
They're like a lie detector test.

26
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,919
That's why I told you
we shouldn't do it.

27
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,158
I'm sorry, Tae-Gyeong.

28
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:00,639
But it's because you're the only person
that can do it.

29
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,798
But what's the New Light Prince?

30
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,039
Well...

31
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,399
Saebit Day is the charity event
hosted by Saebit Foundation.

32
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:11,919
During that event, the part
that raises the most donations is...

33
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:16,038
the New Light Prince Contest.
That's what they say.

34
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:18,839
If I were to give you more details,
it's exactly what it sounds like.

35
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:21,399
They choose the most handsome
and popular person for it.

36
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:24,038
It's tradition for someone
in the student council to do it.

37
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:27,399
Da-On, who couldn't make it
because of his exams,

38
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,918
won last year.

39
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:32,999
It was incredible back then.

40
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,959
In any case,
the New Light Prince this year...

41
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,089
will be Tae-Gyeong.

42
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,318
He's very handsome, just like me.

43
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,239
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,119
Why are you worried, Tae-Gyeong?

45
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:51,679
I'm sure you will win.

46
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:54,758
The best stylist ever, me, Namkung,
will help you,

47
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,918
so don't worry.

48
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,679
You don't have to wear your uniform.

49
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,598
I have to prepare an outfit
and go on stage all by myself?

50
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,878
I'm really bad at that.

51
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,758
Don't worry about that.

52
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:10,598
You will have a manager
to help you with everything.

53
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:11,999
Who is it?

54
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,198
It's Noh Shin-Woo.

55
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:17,038
What?

56
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,198
Shin-Woo will be Prince Tae-Gyeong's...

57
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,679
manager.

58
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,718
Give him a round of applause.

59
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:25,399
That's a great idea.

60
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,079
This is great, Tae-Gyeong.

61
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,119
Right.

62
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:39,038
Do you have time tomorrow?

63
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,359
Yes, of course.

64
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,559
Then do you want to meet at
K Shopping Mall at 12 tomorrow?

65
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:48,119
Sure.

66
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:52,598
What about lunch?
Are you going to eat first?

67
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,519
No. Let's eat together.

68
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,638
Okay.

69
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:00,959
- Also...
- What?

70
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,478
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

71
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,598
Why are you asking me about that?

72
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:09,598
I'm going to be dressed
in an effortlessly chic look.

73
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:12,918
What does it mean
to be effortlessly chic?

74
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,559
I'm just going to wear whatever I see.

75
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:19,758
How have you never heard of
the effortlessly chic look?

76
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:20,959
Is that so wrong?

77
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:23,119
Everyone these days knows what that is.

78
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,799
- Do you know everything?
- Of course I do.

79
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:27,518
Plus, I'm not a picky eater.

80
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,119
Da-On. What are you doing?

81
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,679
Is that for me?

82
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,838
- What?
- Nothing. I'm just kidding.

83
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,239
Let's go eat
in the student council room.

84
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:58,799
(Chats, Noh Shin-Woo)

85
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,078
(Tae-Gyeong leave the chatroom.
Leave. Did you do it?)

86
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:03,438
(I'm not going to do it.)

87
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,239
Is he ignoring me?

88
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,119
(Enter search words.)

89
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,758
(The meaning of effortlessly chic)

90
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,878
(It means you're dressed up
but not too dressed up.)

91
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,039
(Dressed up but not too dressed up)

92
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,758
"Dressed up but not too dressed up"?

93
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,398
(The meaning of effortlessly chic)

94
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:48,078
What does that mean?

95
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:52,878
(Tae-Gyeong: Don't be late tomorrow.)

96
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,518
(Tae-Gyeong)

97
00:06:03,318 --> 00:06:05,919
(Don't be late tomorrow.)

98
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,039
He's ignoring me again?

99
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:09,359
(Go to bed.)

100
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:10,398
Wait.

101
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,438
Darn it.

102
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,719
I read it right away.

103
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,198
What if he thinks I was waiting
for his text?

104
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:42,679
"How to go on a nice date".

105
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:46,318
(The first tip
on having a successful date.)

106
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:49,438
(Look at them in the eyes while having
a conversation.)

107
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:53,799
(Be sure to nod and show that
you can relate to them.)

108
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,479
(Cupid of Love's answer)

109
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,119
Tae-Gyeong.

110
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,159
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,239
Did you wait long?

112
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,878
Yes. Why were you so late?

113
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:45,679
I overslept.

114
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:47,958
You never oversleep.

115
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,239
I went to bed late last night.

116
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,198
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,159
Why are you laughing?

118
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,039
It's nothing.

119
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,919
I'm wondering if this is
your effortlessly chic look.

120
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,078
You got pretty dressed up today.

121
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:22,039
Were you late because
you were choosing this outfit?

122
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:24,638
I picked it out last night.

123
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,479
You picked it out last night?

124
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,359
So you overslept because
you were picking this out?

125
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:33,159
Be quiet. Let's go.

126
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:44,089
Teasing him is pretty fun.

127
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:53,119
What do you think about this?

128
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:01,119
(Look at them in the eyes while having
a conversation.)

129
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:04,599
(Be sure to nod and show that
you can relate to them.)

130
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,359
Is it okay?

131
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:18,558
What about this one?

132
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:28,558
What about this?

133
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,209
How about this?

134
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,329
Are you broken?

135
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,329
You don't want to be my manager, do you?

136
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:07,878
I mean, no. It's not that.

137
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,089
Fine. I'm glad you're being honest.

138
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:14,119
Let's just look around here and go.

139
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:16,839
No. Let's look at everything.

140
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:19,209
I didn't even eat.

141
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,158
We agreed to eat together.

142
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,918
I wanted these.

143
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:49,798
Does it clash with our concept?

144
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,518
Why do you keep doing that?

145
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,558
What?

146
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,719
You keep glaring at me.

147
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:05,558
And when I ask you something,

148
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,038
you just nod insincerely.

149
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,038
If you're going to do that,
just go home.

150
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,278
Are you mad?

151
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:38,798
Yes.

152
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,398
You came here to help me,

153
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,719
but you weren't helpful.

154
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:49,959
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:55,079
It's fine.

156
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:58,119
You must be tired
because you didn't get a lot of sleep.

157
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,158
You can go home after we drink this.

158
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,918
I'll just look around
some more by myself...

159
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,959
No!

160
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,798
I want to stay here...

161
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:16,558
with you.

162
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,158
I want to be here with you.

163
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:28,999
Oh, well...

164
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:33,079
After seeing the clothes you chose,

165
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,798
I thought youⒹ need some help.

166
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,079
Oh, right. Fine.

167
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:57,839
Here.

168
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:13,798
Are these for me?

169
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:16,878
Yes.

170
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:21,638
I just wanted to get you a present.

171
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:26,678
Wear these
and don't be nervous on stage.

172
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,558
As for the clothes...

173
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,398
You looked good in everything.

174
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,518
You have a small face,

175
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:39,599
you're pale,

176
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,678
and you're handsome.

177
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,719
Oh, right. Well...

178
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,479
I need to buy a hat.

179
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,398
Can you help me choose one out?

180
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:17,918
Oh, my. It's cute.

181
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,918
It looks really cute.
I'll take a photo for you.

182
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,479
Hey.

183
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,119
Do you...

184
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:35,199
want to take one with me?

185
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:38,758
Sure.

186
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:01,158
(Slightly less handsome Tae-Gyeong)

187
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,398
(What do you think of this hat?
Noh Shin-Woo picked it out.)

188
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:07,038
I chose a great manager for him.

189
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,038
- What?
- What?

190
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,678
Oh, well...

191
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:20,479
Tae-Gyeong...

192
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:23,878
is going to participate
in the New Light Prince Contest.

193
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,638
I thought heⒹ struggle on his own,

194
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:27,439
so I had Shin-Woo
help him has his manager.

195
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,398
I see. Good job.

196
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:39,038
How are things between
you and Tae-Gyeong? Did you guys talk?

197
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,359
- Not yet.
- Da-On!

198
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,518
- What?
- Don't look at me like that.

199
00:15:49,558 --> 00:15:52,719
You look really sad,
so it makes you look handsomer.

200
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,999
You make me laugh.

201
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,638
Right. You should smile like that.

202
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,119
You're almost as handsome as me,

203
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:03,839
so when you smile, you look quite nice.

204
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,678
So?

205
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,239
When are you going to talk to him?

206
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,518
I want to talk to him in person,

207
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,038
but we never bump into each other.

208
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,719
That makes sense.

209
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:21,758
You can't come to the student council
room because of your exams,

210
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:23,158
and you're in a different grade.

211
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,278
Shin-Woo and Tae-Gyeong
are always together,

212
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,479
so they fight
and make up really quickly.

213
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,558
Are you going to contact him?

214
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:41,518
No. There's another way.

215
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:44,398
Right. You always know what to do.

216
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,999
I'll see you later, Namkung.

217
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,359
Where are you going all of a sudden?

218
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,558
Something suddenly came up.
I'm really sorry.

219
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,649
Gosh, we did a great job shopping today.

220
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:22,518
I'm going to win no matter what.

221
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,199
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,838
I sincerely want to apologize...

223
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:57,409
for what I did to you.

224
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,919
I was envious of you.

225
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:04,758
I liked Da-On before you,

226
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,889
but it seemed like Da-On...

227
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:11,409
liked you more than me.

228
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:15,318
I thought that you were stealing
Da-On from me.

229
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:18,719
Da-On doesn't even belong to me.

230
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,758
I...

231
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:25,318
can't say that it's okay right now.

232
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:28,679
But it will become okay.

233
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,679
We have something in common.

234
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:36,598
We both really like Da-On.

235
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,118
I don't.

236
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:46,169
Who does something like that
to someone they like?

237
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,959
I have no right to like him.

238
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:55,439
Do you remember what you said to me?

239
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,679
Hi. It's been three years
since I liked Sin Da-On.

240
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,169
My name is Lee So-Hee.

241
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:07,959
When I met you, this is what I thought.

242
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,598
"Gosh, she's so honest and cool."

243
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,479
That's when...

244
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:18,479
I wanted to become friends with you.

245
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:22,959
Out of all the people that I know,

246
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,239
you're the most courageous...

247
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,318
and coolest person.

248
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:34,239
So let's become friends one day, okay?

249
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,959
We could become friends from now on.

250
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:40,278
To celebrate becoming friends...

251
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,479
Here.

252
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:48,239
What is this?

253
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,758
I heard you were participating
in the New Light Prince Contest.

254
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,409
Namkung told me.

255
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:57,409
Right.

256
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:00,038
I got it because I thought
it would look good on you.

257
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:05,318
Thank you, So-Hee.

258
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,318
Don't be.

259
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:11,318
I'm more grateful, Tae-Gyeong.

260
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,358
I'll get going.

261
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,078
Okay. Goodbye.

262
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,479
Okay. I'll see you around.

263
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:47,169
What are you thinking about?

264
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,518
Just...

265
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:53,919
I wonder what Da-On is doing right now.

266
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,358
So-Hee said it's been a while
since she saw Da-On too.

267
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,239
He doesn't answer her calls either.

268
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,078
Is he okay?

269
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,598
Do you miss him?

270
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:12,838
I just...

271
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,719
want to know if he's doing okay.

272
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:20,598
I'm worried.

273
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,358
I know you don't want to see me.

274
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:51,409
But can you just give me
a moment of your time?

275
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:58,278
After what happened between us,

276
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,959
I couldn't sleep,

277
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,838
and I couldn't eat.

278
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,879
I thought IⒹ be more tormented
if I didn't say anything.

279
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:17,679
I'm sorry for putting you through
all that pain...

280
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,838
just because I liked you.

281
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:23,679
I'm sorry for hurting
the person you like.

282
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:31,278
You can stay mad at me if you want,
and it's okay if you hate me.

283
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:33,719
But...

284
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:37,159
I'm not okay with you saying
you never want to see me again.

285
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:48,199
So-Hee.

286
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,959
I understand, so stop crying.

287
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,078
Your eyes are going to get swollen.

288
00:22:57,118 --> 00:22:58,598
I don't hate you.

289
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,479
I'll take back what I said about
never seeing you again.

290
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:03,358
But...

291
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,199
I don't think we can
be good friends right now.

292
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,318
Right.

293
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:13,959
I can wait.

294
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,118
Were you going somewhere?

295
00:23:24,318 --> 00:23:25,798
To meet someone.

296
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,639
Is it Woo Tae-Gyeong?

297
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:33,919
Tae-Gyeong is a good guy.

298
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,439
I can see why you like him now.

299
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:38,358
Right.

300
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:41,798
I know that Tae-Gyeong is a good guy.

301
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:43,959
That's why...

302
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:49,159
I'm going to start all over again.

303
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,959
You went through so much trouble
being my manager...

304
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,159
and shopping with me.

305
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:10,159
Thank you.

306
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:15,959
Thanks for the shoes too.

307
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,598
Hey, Tae-Gyeong.

308
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,999
Yes?

309
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,358
I'm sure you know this,

310
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,639
but I'm bad...

311
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,639
at expressing myself.

312
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:38,879
That's why when I met someone
as honest as you,

313
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:44,479
I thought it was interesting at first,
and I got curious,

314
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:46,959
and...

315
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:51,959
I wanted to spend more time with you.

316
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:58,798
So?

317
00:24:59,838 --> 00:25:02,719
Right, so...

318
00:25:03,518 --> 00:25:05,278
What I want to say is...

319
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:13,639
I...

320
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:17,518
am not disqualified as your manager,
right?

321
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:23,758
Right. You'll continue to be my manager.

322
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:27,118
You have to stay by my side every day
and answer all of my questions...

323
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,358
and do everything I tell you to do.

324
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,798
Hey, that's...

325
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:31,999
So...

326
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:34,959
don't worry and go home and sleep.

327
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,639
You didn't lose your job.

328
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:47,838
I had a lot of fun today.

329
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:50,999
I'll see you at school.

330
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:11,719
"Stay..."

331
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,999
"by my side."

332
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:25,118
He knows
how to make a person's heart flutter.

333
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:52,159
Hi,

334
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,358
Tae-Gyeong.

335
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:08,038
=Light on Me=

336
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:10,679
(How are things between you and Da-On?)

337
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,798
What do you think? Do we seem awkward?

338
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,479
It's an hour before the contest.

339
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:16,598
Where did it go? Where is it?

340
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:19,318
- Are you looking for something?
(- Did something happen?)

341
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:21,159
(Tae-Gyeong.)

342
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:23,118
Shin-Woo...
